# TraceflowObservationDropped

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**timestamp_micro** | **int** | Timestamp when the observation was created by the transport node (microseconds epoch) | [optional] 
**component_sub_type** | **str** | The sub type of the component that issued the observation. | [optional] 
**resource_type** | **str** |  | 
**component_type** | **str** | The type of the component that issued the observation. | [optional] 
**transport_node_name** | **str** | name of the transport node that observed a traceflow packet | [optional] 
**timestamp** | **int** | Timestamp when the observation was created by the transport node (milliseconds epoch) | [optional] 
**transport_node_id** | **str** | id of the transport node that observed a traceflow packet | [optional] 
**sequence_no** | **int** | the hop count for observations on the transport node that a traceflow packet is injected in will be 0. The hop count is incremented each time a subsequent transport node receives the traceflow packet. The sequence number of 999 indicates that the hop count could not be determined for the containing observation. | [optional] 
**transport_node_type** | **str** | type of the transport node that observed a traceflow packet | [optional] 
**component_name** | **str** | The name of the component that issued the observation. | [optional] 
**nat_rule_id** | **int** | The ID of the NAT rule that was applied to forward the traceflow packet | [optional] 
**reason** | **str** | The reason traceflow packet was dropped | [optional] 
**lport_id** | **str** | The id of the logical port at which the traceflow packet was dropped | [optional] 
**lport_name** | **str** | The name of the logical port at which the traceflow packet was dropped | [optional] 
**acl_rule_id** | **int** | The id of the acl rule that was applied to drop the traceflow packet | [optional] 
**arp_fail_reason** | **str** | This field specifies the ARP fails reason ARP_TIMEOUT - ARP failure due to query control plane timeout ARP_CPFAIL - ARP failure due post ARP query message to control plane failure ARP_FROMCP - ARP failure due to deleting ARP entry from control plane ARP_PORTDESTROY - ARP failure due to port destruction ARP_TABLEDESTROY - ARP failure due to ARP table destruction ARP_NETDESTROY - ARP failure due to overlay network destruction | [optional]
