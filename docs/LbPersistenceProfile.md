# LbPersistenceProfile

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**system_owned** | **bool** | Indicates system owned resource | [optional] 
**display_name** | **str** | Defaults to ID if not set | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | Description of this resource | [optional] 
**tags** | [**list[Tag]**](Tag.md) | Opaque identifiers meaningful to the API user | [optional] 
**create_user** | **str** | ID of the user who created this resource | [optional] 
**protection** | **str** | Protection status is one of the following: PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is not allowed             to modify it. NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite&#x3D;true. UNKNOWN - the _protection field could not be determined for this           entity.  | [optional] 
**create_time** | **int** | Timestamp of resource creation | [optional] 
**last_modified_time** | **int** | Timestamp of last modification | [optional] 
**last_modified_user** | **str** | ID of the user who last modified this resource | [optional] 
**id** | **str** | Unique identifier of this resource | [optional] 
**resource_type** | **str** | The resource_type property identifies persistence profile type.  | 
**persistence_shared** | **bool** | The persistence shared flag identifies whether the persistence table is shared among virtual-servers referring this profile. If persistence shared flag is not set in the cookie persistence profile bound to a virtual server, it defaults to cookie persistence that is private to each virtual server and is qualified by the pool. This is accomplished by load balancer inserting a cookie with name in the format &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;virtual_server_id&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;pool_id&amp;gt;. If persistence shared flag is set in the cookie persistence profile, in cookie insert mode, cookie persistence could be shared across multiple virtual servers that are bound to the same pools. The cookie name would be changed to &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;profile-id&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;pool-id&amp;gt;. If persistence shared flag is not set in the sourceIp persistence profile bound to a virtual server, each virtual server that the profile is bound to maintains its own private persistence table. If persistence shared flag is set in the sourceIp persistence profile, all virtual servers the profile is bound to share the same persistence table. If persistence shared flag is not set in the generic persistence profile, the persistence entries are matched and stored in the table which is identified using both virtual server ID and profile ID. If persistence shared flag is set in the generic persistence profile, the persistence entries are matched and stored in the table which is identified using profile ID. It means that virtual servers which consume the same profile in the LbRule with this flag enabled are sharing the same persistence table.  | [optional] [default to False]
