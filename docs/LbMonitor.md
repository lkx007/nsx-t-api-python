Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**system_owned** | **bool** | Indicates system owned resource | [optional] 
**display_name** | **str** | Defaults to ID if not set | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | Description of this resource | [optional] 
**tags** | [**list[Tag]**](Tag.md) | Opaque identifiers meaningful to the API user | [optional] 
**create_user** | **str** | ID of the user who created this resource | [optional] 
**protection** | **str** | Protection status is one of the following: PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is not allowed             to modify it. NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite&#x3D;true.

**last_modified_time** | **int** | Timestamp of last modification | [optional] 
**last_modified_user** | **str** | ID of the user who last modified this resource | [optional] 
**id** | **str** | Unique identifier of this resource | [optional] 
**resource_type** | **str** | Load balancers monitor the health of backend servers to ensure traffic is not black holed. There are two types of healthchecks: active and passive. Passive healthchecks depend on failures in actual client traffic (e.g. RST from server in response to a client connection) to detect that the server or the application is down. In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their health, completely independent of any data traffic. Currently, active health monitors are supported for HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols.  |
