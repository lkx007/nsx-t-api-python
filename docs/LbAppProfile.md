# LbAppProfile

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**system_owned** | **bool** | Indicates system owned resource | [optional] 
**display_name** | **str** | Defaults to ID if not set | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | Description of this resource | [optional] 
**tags** | [**list[Tag]**](Tag.md) | Opaque identifiers meaningful to the API user | [optional] 
**create_user** | **str** | ID of the user who created this resource | [optional] 
**protection** | **str** | Protection status is one of the following: PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is not allowed             to modify it. NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite&#x3D;true. UNKNOWN - the _protection field could not be determined for this           entity.  | [optional] 
**create_time** | **int** | Timestamp of resource creation | [optional] 
**last_modified_time** | **int** | Timestamp of last modification | [optional] 
**last_modified_user** | **str** | ID of the user who last modified this resource | [optional] 
**id** | **str** | Unique identifier of this resource | [optional] 
**resource_type** | **str** | An application profile can be bound to a virtual server to specify the application protocol characteristics. It is used to influence how load balancing is performed. Currently, three types of application profiles are supported: LbFastTCPProfile, LbFastUDPProfile and LbHttpProfile. LbFastTCPProfile or LbFastUDPProfile is typically used when the application is using a custom protocol or a standard protocol not supported by the load balancer. It is also used in cases where the user only wants L4 load balancing mainly because L4 load balancing has much higher performance and scalability, and/or supports connection mirroring. LbHttpProfile is used for both HTTP and HTTPS applications. Though application rules, if bound to the virtual server, can be used to accomplish the same goal, LbHttpProfile is intended to simplify enabling certain common use cases.  |
